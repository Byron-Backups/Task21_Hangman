# Task 21 - Hangman Game
This is a Hangman Game made in React JS.

It is a fun game where you are provided with a mystery word and have to
guess the word before you run out of guesses.
## Deployment

You can either download the source code or as a zip file.
If you dowloaded the .zip then you need to extract the file.

You will need to have Node.js installed as well as Node Package Manager.
(although NPM usually comes bundled with Node.js)

You can check that both are installed by running in the terminal:

```bash
  node -v
```
```bash
  npm -v
```

Once that is done you are ready to deploy, but you will need your own Node modules.
To deploy this project, open the terminal and set the directory to the project location,
(Eg; Desktop\MyApps\project) and then run:

```bash
  npm start
```
